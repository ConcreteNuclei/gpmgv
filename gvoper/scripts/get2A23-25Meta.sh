# get2A23-25Meta.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    October 2006
#
# DESCRIPTION
# Wrapper script called from getPRdaily.sh.  Runs the two metadata extraction
# scripts, get2A23Meta.sh and get2A25Meta.sh, which call IDL routines to do the
# metadata generation, and then load their respective IDL outputs to the 'gpmgv'
# database.  Passes along a single argument, a 'yymmdd' date string, to the two
# scripts.  (Note that success in processing metadata for a set of PR files
# is dependent on having the CT data for all the dates indicated by the files,
# since the metadata are tagged to the overpass event IDs defined by the CT
# file entries for our sites of interest -- see HISTORY, 1/26/07 for how this
# is handled in the latest incarnation.)
#
# HISTORY
# 1/26/07 - Morris - Added tests to see if CT data is missing, on a date-by-
# date basis.  Note, we can be missing an earlier CT file download which
# overlaps the data dates for which we got PR files in today's attempt --
# even if we got the most recent CT file.  This can happen when we get more than
# one day's worth of PR subset files due to a failed/missing earlier attempt,
# but the CT downloads have not caught up or are still not available.
# Before this change, we would not indicate a failure as long as at least one
# of the orbits we were processing had coincidence event data, regardless of
# how many other days/orbits were missing CT events.  This resulted in partial
# metadata, with no attempt to recover the missing part.  Now we flag a date's
# attempt as MISSING unless the CT data are present for *ALL* PR file dates.
#
# IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD GET PR ORBIT SUBSET FILES FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO
# CT ENTRIES, EVEN WHEN THE CT FILES ARE ALL UP-TO-DATE?  ANSWER IS YES, so need
# to assure that downloaded/db-loaded CT dates cover our set of PR file dates.
# Cannot compare PR file orbit numbers one-by-one to CT orbit numbers, as we
# have a zero-to-many relationship between PR files and site overpasses.)
#
# 2/12/08 - Morris - Modified the query which produces the control file info to
# take the 'subset' of the 2A23 file into account, so that we don't get a
# radar_id counted/included in the output which is not associated with the PR
# product subset.  This issue came up when the DARW radar was added to the list
# of stations processed in the CT files and caused incomplete metadata runs.
#
# 11/8/13 - Morris - Using >> rather than "| tee -a" to capture any psql
# error output in main query.
#
# 4/24/14 - Morris - Increased ntries from 5 to 10 before declaring FAILURE.
#
# 8/26/14 - Morris - Changed LOG_DIR to /data/logs and TMP_DIR to /data/tmp
