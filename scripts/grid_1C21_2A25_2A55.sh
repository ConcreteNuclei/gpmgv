# grid_1C21_2A25_2A55.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    October 2006
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Runs IDL in batch mode to generate 3D grids and write them to netCDF files
#   for NEXRAD sites overpassed in each orbit.  Files, orbits, and overpassed
#   NEXRAD sites are listed in the well-known filename whose YYMMDD date part
#   is provided as the single argument to this script.  This filename is set
#   as an environment variable so that IDL can extract the filename from the
#   environment.  The script tracks the status of grid processing for the date
#   YYMMDD via entries in the 'appstatus' table in the 'gpmgv' database, and
#   takes appropriate actions according to the status of the date's grid run.
#   It also looks at the status of dates other than YYMMDD to see if there is a
#   need to re-try processing for dates where the prior run was unsuccessful.
#
#   This script has a sleep/retry feature in case the IDL single-user license
#   is occupied by another user/process.  It will sleep 30 minutes between
#   attempts.  After 8 times hitting the Snooze button, it will give up and
#   flag the timed-out run to be reattempted the next time this script is run.
#
# ARGUMENTS
#   YYMMDD - A single string listing the 2-digit year, month, and day of the
#            site overpasses for which grids are to be generated.  No validity
#            checks are performed on the value of this date string, other than
#            that is must fit within the database field 'datestamp'.
#
# FILES
#   PR_files_sites4gridCases.YYMMDD.txt (INPUT) - lists data files, orbits, and
#                                      NEXRAD sites overpassed in each orbit. 
#                                      YYMMDD is passed to this script as the
#                                      sole argument.  YYMMDD is the yr, month,
#                                      day of the run, not necessarily of the
#                                      data.  The full file pathname is
#                                      generated within this script.
#   get_pr_and_gv_ncgrids.bat (INTERNAL) - Batch file of IDL commands to be run.
#
#  DATABASE
#    Status of this script's runs are maintained in the 'appstatus' table,
#    in rows tagged with the app_id attribute value 'gridPRandGV'.
#
#  LOGS
#    Output for script run is logged to file grid_1C21_2A25_2A55.log
#    in the $LOG_DIR directory, unless improper number of arguments are passed.
#    In this case the error is written to a current-date-specific log file
#    grid_1C21_2A25_2A55.yymmdd.fatal.log in $LOG_DIR, where 'yymmdd' is for the
#    date the script run was attempted, not the input data date.
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT privileges on tables. 
#      Utility 'psql' must be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $TMP_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories
