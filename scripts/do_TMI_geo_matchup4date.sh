#  do_TMI_geo_matchup4date.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    May 2011
#
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#   Called by doTMIGeoMatch4NewRainCases.sh, which generates the needed inputs.
#   Runs IDL in batch mode to generate GV-TMI matchups and write them to netCDF
#   files, for radar sites that are overpassed in each orbit for a specified
#   date (UTC) and have precipitation echoes.  Files, orbits, and overpassed
#   radar sites are listed in the well-known filename whose YYMMDD date stamp
#   is provided as the single argument to this script.  This filename is set
#   as an environment variable so that IDL can extract the filename from the
#   environment.  The script tracks the status of data processing for the date
#   YYMMDD via entries in the 'appstatus' table in the 'gpmgv' database, and
#   takes appropriate actions according to the status of the date's run.
#
#   This script has a sleep/retry feature in case the IDL single-user license
#   is occupied by another user/process.  It will sleep 30 minutes between
#   attempts.  After 8 times hitting the Snooze button, it will give up and
#   flag the timed-out run to be reattempted the next time this script is run.
#
#
#  ARGUMENTS
#
#   YYMMDD - A single string listing the 2-digit year, month, and day of the
#            site overpasses for which matchups are to be generated.  No validity
#            checks are performed on the value of this date string, other than
#            that it must fit within the database field 'datestamp'.
#
#
#  FILES
#
#   TMI_files_sites4geoMatch.YYMMDD.txt (INPUT)
#                            - lists data files, orbits, and NEXRAD sites
#                              overpassed in each orbit.  YYMMDD is passed
#                              to this script as the sole argument. YYMMDD 
#                              is the yr, month, day of the run, not
#                              necessarily of the data.  The full file
#                              pathname is generated within this script.
#
#   polar2tmi.bat (INTERNAL) - Batch file of IDL commands to be run.
#
#
#  DATABASE
#
#    Status of this script's runs are maintained in the 'appstatus' table,
#    in rows tagged with the app_id attribute value 'geo_match_tmi'.
#
#
#  LOGS
#
#    Output for script run is logged to file do_TMI_geo_matchup4date.yymmdd.log
#    in the $LOG_DIR directory, where 'yymmdd' is the input data date,
#    unless improper number of arguments are passed. In this case the error is
#    logged to the current-date-tagged file do_TMI_geo_matchup.yymmdd.fatal.log
#    in $LOG_DIR, where 'yymmdd' is for the date the script run was attempted,
#    not the input data date.
#
#
#  RETURN VALUES
#
#    0 = normal, successfully created new matchup files
#    1 = error in processing or no input data; no matchup files created
#    2 = already successfully ran matchups for this date, do nothing
#
#
#  CONSTRAINTS
#
#    - User under which script is run must have access privileges to PostGRESQL
#      database 'gpmgv', and SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT privileges on tables. 
#      Utility 'psql' must be in user's $PATH.
#    - User must have write privileges in $TMP_DIR, $LOG_DIR directories
