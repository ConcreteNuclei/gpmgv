# doGeoMatch4AllCases.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    September 2008
#
# Wrapper to do PR-GV NetCDF geometric matchups for 1C21/2A25/2B31/1CUF files
# already received and cataloged, for cases meeting predefined criteria.
#
# Criteria are as defined in the query which created and populated the table
# "rainy100inside100" in the "gpmgv" database.  Includes cases where the PR
# indicates "rain certain" at 100 or more gridpoints within 100 km of the radar
# within the 4km gridded 2A-25 product.  See file 'rainCases100.sql'.
#
# NOTE:  When running dates that might have already had PR-GV matchup sets
#        run, the called script will skip these dates, as the 'appstatus' table
#        will say that the date has already been done.  Delete the entries
#        from this table where app_id='geo_match', either for the date(s) to be
#        run, or for all dates.
#
# 6/9/2010    Morris         Created from doGrids4Select100in100Cases.sh
#                            - Disabled capability to determine the
#                            starting date of new data to process - just do all.
