# updateGrids4Select100in100Cases.sh    Morris/SAIC/GPM GV    July 2008
#
# Wrapper to do NetCDF grid creation for 1C21/2A25/2B31/2A55/2A54/2A53 files
# already received and cataloged, for cases meeting predefined criteria.
#
# Criteria are as defined in the query which created and populated the table
# "rainy100inside100" in the "gpmgv" database.  Includes cases where the PR
# indicates "rain certain" at 100 or more gridpoints within 100 km of the radar
# within the 4km gridded 2A-25 product.  See file 'rainCases100.sql'.
#
# NOTE:  When running grids for dates that might have already had other grids
#        run, the called script will skip these dates, as the 'appstatus' table
#        will say that the date has already been done.  Need to delete the
#        entries from this table where app_id='ncgridPRGV' for the dates to be
#        run, or all dates.
#
# 06/12/2007 Morris         Added 2A54 and 2A53 products to the GV output file
#                           lists.  Now query collatedGVproducts view for these
#                           file pathnames.
# 08/2007    Morris         Added 2B31 product to the PR output file list.
# 05/2008    Morris         Limited last query to 1 row for each orbit for 
#                           ARMOR script version, where Walt provided more than
#                           one volume for some overpass events.
# 07/2008    Morris         Modified to do RGSN cases using full-orbit PR files.
# 07/2008    Morris         Modified 1st query to use CT-based dates rather than
#                           those from the PR product filenames, so that the dates
#                           correspond to the events tallied in other tables in
#                           subsequent queries.
# 07/2008    Morris         - Created from doGrids4Select100in100Cases.sh
#                           - Modified 2nd query to add YYMMDD constant field to
#                           end of row for IDL's parsing/usage for when running
#                           multiple days' grids in one invocation of IDL, and
#                           added subset to the select list for use in the 3rd
#                           query.  Otherwise, count(*) can be wrong for the
#                           number of rows returned in the 3rd query.
#                           - Limited last query to 1 row for each event due to
#                           ARMOR 1CUF volumes, where Walt provided more than
#                           one volume for some overpass events, which causes
#                           collatedGVproducts to produce duplicate/multiple rows;
#                           added subset to the WHERE criteria to fix this 
#                           oversight that caused the same symptom for other sites.
