;
; DESCRIPTION
; -----------
; Computes a best estimate of the mean bright band height from an array of
; bright band heights from the 2A-25 RangeBinNums field, using a histogram
; analysis, finding the histogram peak corresponding to the bright band height.
; Optionally, plots the histogram of bright band height, tagged with the peak
; determined to be at the location of the bright band.
;
; If the 2A23 BBstatus array is provided as a second non-keyword parameter, then
; the histogram technique will be used as the fallback technique only if no
; points meeting the 'good' or 'fair' BB status are identified.  Otherwise, the
; mean BB height will be computed as the mean of the BB heights for the 'good'
; points (if any) or 'fair' points (if any, and if no 'good' points).
;
; PARAMETERS
; ----------
; bb2hist     - array of bright band height for the PR rays in consideration.
; bbstatus    - array of 2A23 BBstatus values for the PR rays in consideration
;               (must match the bb2hist rays one-to-one).  If not present, the
;               technique will default to the histogram analysis method of
;               determining the mean BB height.
; bs          - the bin size (km) to using in generating the histogram of BB
;               height. Defaults to 0.2 km if not specified.
; hist_window - number of the IDL window in which to plot the histogram of
;               bright band height.  If not specified, then the histogram is
;               not plotted and detailed diagnostics are not printed.
;
; MODULES
; -------
; get_mean_bb_by_histo() - Legacy routine using only 2A25 BB heights to compute
;                          mean BB height via a histogram analysis.
; get_mean_bb_height()   - Computes mean BB heights using BB heights from 2A25,
;                          and matching BBstatus values from 2A23 (if provided,
;                          and if BBstatus of any points meet the 'good' or
;                          'fair' criteria).  Otherwise uses BB heights only and
;                          calls get_mean_bb_by_histo() as a fallback method.
;
; HISTORY
; -------
; 04/22/10 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV:  Created.
; 05/13/10 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV
; - Made all print statements conditional on hist_window parameter presence.
; 08/10/10 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV
; - Replaced calls to lclxtrem() with call to local_maxima().
; 03/01/12 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV
; - Added 'bbstatus' parameter and capability of using it to compute the mean
;   BB height using the 2A23 information, if available.  Moved old function's
;   logic to new internal function "get_mean_bb_by_histo()", called if 2A23
;   bbstatus is missing or if no points qualify. (Rolled changes in from file
;   get_mean_bb_height2.pro to get this version.)
; 10/14/14 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV
; - Modified get_mean_bb_by_histo() to handle case where no maxima exist in the
;   histogram.  Just returns mean value of defined-BB samples in this case.
;   Need to add a QC flag to allow caller to decide what to do with such cases.
; 08/16/17 - Morris/NASA/GSFC (SAIC), GPM GV
; - Added GPM parameter to instruct the primary routine to use the GPM
;   2ADPR/Ka/Ku qualityBB flag definitions rather than the default TRMM 2A23
;   BBstatus flag definitions.
