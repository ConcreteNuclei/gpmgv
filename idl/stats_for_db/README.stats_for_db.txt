README file for GPM GV software for comparison of radar reflectivity between 
TRMM PR and ground radars, using gridded data contained in netCDF grid files, 
with statistics written to a delimited file for loading into the 'gpmgv' 
database.  These procedures are of little use outside of the gpmgv database 
environment.

In this set of IDL applications, the PR netCDF reflectivity data is 
compared to: (a) the 2A-55-derived GV netCDF data, and (b) the REORDER-derived 
GV netCDF data.  Each of the GV types are stored in separate netCDF files.

The top level IDL procedure, stratified_by_dist_stats_to_dbfile_55_or_reo.pro, 
walks through the list of PR netCDF files in the netcdf/PR directory; finds the 
matching GV and GV-REORDER netCDF file(s) for each PR netCDF file; copies, 
uncompresses, opens, and reads necessary data fields from each netCDF file; 
does some preprocessing and cleanup of the data fields; and calls the procedure 
stratify_diffs21dist to compute the reflectivity differences for the case.  The 
stratified reflectivity differences are then written to a delimited ASCII text 
file by printf_stat_struct21dist.pro, in a format ready to be loaded into the 
'gpmgv' database.  This sequence is repeated for each PR netCDF file.

Other top-level programs in the /stats_for_db directory perform similar 
functions, but for different stratifications of the data, or with different 
data constraints.  These procedures include:

- stratified_by_angle_stats_to_dbfile.pro
- stratified_by_dist_stats_to_dbfile.pro
- stratified_by_sfc_stats_to_dbfile.pro
- stratified_stats_to_dbfile.pro
